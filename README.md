# darwin-rs
Darwin Kernel Bindings and Primatives

## Coming Soon!
We are working hard on some security tools for darwin built in rust!
Currently darwin-rs is tightly coupled with the tools we are building
but fear not we love opensource and will be releasing code soon.

## Features
* `no_std`
* Rust allocator support for darwin
* All major primatives supported (Kernel Control, Read / Write locks, VFS / VNode support, KAuth, Processes, Kernel Threads, Mach Task)
* 100% rust, binding directly to Apples public C kernel API.
